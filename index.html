        <div class="priorities-list">
          <!-- Priority 1 -->
          <div class="priority-card" tabindex="0">
            <span class="priority-visual"><img src="assets/priority-physicians-dentists.png" alt="Physicians and Dentists Collaboration" /></span>

            <div class="priority-details" id="priority1-details" hidden>
              <h4>Problem</h4>
              <p>Today, when medical treatment (such as cancer care or heart surgery) requires dental involvement, there's no standardized way for doctors to refer patients to dentists or share the treatment plan—making coordination difficult. Additionally, the lack of ability to refer dentists from a medical office is costly and creates burden for emergency rooms, specialists, and patients.</p>
              <h4>Solution</h4>
              <p>Implement standards-based referral systems and data sharing using existing and updated health care interoperability standards (like CDS Hooks, SMART on FHIR, and subscriptions). Medical offices will be able to systematically send patient information to dental practices, enabling coordinated care and efficient treatment planning. Enhance dental systems to implement similar standards so data can also be shared back to physician offices when needed.</p>

            <div class="priority-details" id="priority2-details" hidden>
              <h4>Problem</h4>
              <p>Dental providers struggle to share patient and clinical information securely among offices and practices, often relying on manual processes or incomplete records, which can disrupt continuity of care.</p>
              <h4>Solution</h4>
              <p>Develop and promote open data-sharing standards that allow dental offices to transfer patient files and treatment details electronically with patient consent, improving collaboration and care quality. Efforts are underway at several standards organizations to unify the model for data sharing. OHIA will accelerate the definition and adoption of these models, ensuring consistency, accuracy, and seamless sharing of dental information across systems.</p>

            <button class="priority-toggle" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="priority3-details">Empower Patients by Enabling Access to Dental Records and Claims</button>
            <div class="priority-details" id="priority3-details" hidden>
              <h4>Problem</h4>
              <p>Patients are often unable to readily view or share their dental records and insurance claims due to fragmented systems, multiple logins, and inconsistent standards. This creates confusion, limits data visibility, and adds unnecessary barriers to engaging with their own health information—even when records and claims relate to the same dental encounter.</p>
              <h4>Solution</h4>
              <p>Provide patients the ability to access their dental records, images, medications, and history using secure interoperability solutions that minimize logins and maximize data visibility. Leverage and improve existing standards for claims and encounters (as implemented in CMS-9115-F and enhanced by CMS-0057-F). Accelerate the adoption of other industry-wide interoperability standards and secure digital identity practices, including progress being made as part of CMS Aligned Network pledge. Support emerging and existing efforts to standardize access to images.</p>

              <h4>Problem</h4>
              <p>Patients often struggle to find accurate, up-to-date information about dental providers or available services, resulting in delays and frustration.</p>
              <h4>Solution</h4>
              <p>Enable patients to search for and select dentists easily, aligning with national healthcare directory initiatives. Utilize ongoing initiatives by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and similar organizations to develop open, standards-based dental provider and service directories.</p>

            <div class="priority-details" id="priority5-details" hidden>
              <h4>Problem</h4>
              <p>Determining insurance coverage and eligibility are difficult among dentistry practices and requires patients to re-enter data multiple times. The lack of visibility of eligibility and coverage creates delays.</p>
              <h4>Solution</h4>
              <p>Implement open standards for real-time digital insurance checks, allowing patients to "check in" with digital insurance cards and enabling practices to instantly verify benefits at the point of care.</p>
